        I am Tsouloukidis Zisis 30 years old, I have a degree in economics and I am studying for a second degree in computer science, I believe that my greatest asset is my passion for learning and I believe in lifelong learning. I recently discovered my passion for programming near the end of my studies and started learning self-taught programming separately from my current studies at university, even though I have just started learning how to write code I feel confident about my potential. At the moment I know HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT and I intend to perfect as much as possible the knowledge in them as I will continue to learn everything else I need in order to become a web developer, of course I am not going to stop there I intend to learn other programming languages such as C, C++, PYTHON and JAVA thus enriching my skills.</p>
